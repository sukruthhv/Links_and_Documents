2. How to initialize and add a files to the new repo?
(https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

a. git init
b. git add .
c. git commit -m "Simple commit msg"
d. git remote add origin <remote newly create git URL - which has the .git extension>
e. git push origin master

Now, in the last step, if you get the errors like these :

"! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to '../remote/'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details."

Then this article here :- https://blog.plover.com/prog/git-ff-error.html provides a very good explanation.

Solution is : 

"git pull --rebase origin master"
"git push origin master"
